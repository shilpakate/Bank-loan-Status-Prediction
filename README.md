# Bank-loan-Status-Prediction
Getting a loan approved requires a complex mix of factors not the least of which is a steady income! So this ML project aims to create a model that will classify how much loan the user can obtain based on various factors such as the userâ€™s marital status, income, education, employment prospects, number of dependents, etc. The dataset attached provides details about all these factors which can then be used to create an ML model that demonstrates the amount of loan that can be approved.
